A heap is a way to organize the elements of a range that allows fast retrieval of element with highest value at any moment.(A heap is a complete BT). 

If a node is at index i.
Its left child is at 2*i.
Its right child is at 2*i+1.
Its parent is at i/2.

Full BT :- A binary tree with max number of
                 nodes. If the height of BT is h, then
                 a full BT will have (2^h+1)-1 nodes.
                 A full BT is always complete BT. 
                
Complete BT :- If you represent a BT in a array
                             and there are no empty        
                             location in bw elements, then it
                             is known as complete BT.
                             The height of BT is min only i.e, 
                             log n. 

× Max Heap :- It is a complete BT in which value 
of each parent node is greater than child node. 

× Min Heap :- It is a complete BT in which value 
of each parent node is smaller than child node.

× Time taken for insertion and deletion in   heap :- O(1) to O(log n). Depends on no. of swaps which depends on height of BT i.e, log n.
