Dynamic Programming :- Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a 
recursive solution that has repeated calls for same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming. 
The idea is to simply store the results of subproblems, so that we do not have to re-compute them when needed later.

* Memoization (Top Down)- We tend to store value of subproblems in some map/table. for ex:- fibonacci series
* Tabulation (Bottom Up)- In the tabulation approach to DP (also known as the table-filling method) we solve all 
sub-problems and store their results on a matrix. these results are then used to solve larger problems that depend 
on the previously computed results. Because of this, the tabulation approach is also known as a bottom-up approach.
